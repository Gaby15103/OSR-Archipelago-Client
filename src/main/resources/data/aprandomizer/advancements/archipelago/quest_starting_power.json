    "description": "Early game power and cables. Generate RF from coal. Wrench is used to configure conduits. \nOther pipes and power do exist for later in the game. I would advise against using Cyclic cables. They have been proven to be quite buggy.\n\nHint: Use the Primitive Alloy Smelter to create alloys without power in the early game.\nEnder IO conduit filters and extraction upgrades are avaliable to craft and use. Other mods to transfer items, energy, and fluids are avaliable later in the progression tree (Pipez, Mekanism, Powah, XNet).",
