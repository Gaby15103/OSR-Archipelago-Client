    "description": "The Ritual of Gaia is a trial often undertaken by elves. It yields Gaia Spirits (can be crafted into ingots), which are coveted as fragments of the power of the Goddess of Gaia herself.\n\nThis ritual requires an Active Beacon with Gaia Pylons surrounding it (functioning as an altar), as well as a single Terrasteel Ingot (as a sacrifice).\n\nTo start the ritual, simply sneak-right click the Beacon with the Terrasteel Ingot, take a step back, and prepare to fight for your life. Preparation is absolutely required-- the fight with the Guardian of Gaia can be even harder than that with the Wither. Upon the Guardian\u0027s defeat, a handful of Spirits of Gaia is dropped as a prize.\n\nStandard gear for this ritual is a set of enchanted Elementium Armor, a Terra Blade, and a miscellany of Brews and Trinkets. Do note that the Beacon\u0027s effect is forcibly nullified during the battle.\n\nThe Guardian has a massive pool of health, so preparing with Enchantments and Brews is a must!\n\nThe difficulty of (and reward yielded by) the ritual depends on the number of people participating. Performing the ritual with over five people in the vicinity can be a recipe for disaster with the chaos created, so rituals on that scale probably shouldn\u0027t be attempted.\n\nLastly, it might be a good idea to stay away from the purple.",
