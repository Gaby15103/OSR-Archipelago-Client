    "description": "To use the Infusion Altar, you must first place it down in the world. Make sure the surrounding area is clear of obstructions. Then, you must place Infusion Pedestals around the altar. The altar will show ghost pedestals in the world, indicating where you must place the pedestals.\n\nOnce your altar is set up, you can place items on the altar and pedestals by right-clicking on them with an item in hand.\n\nTo activate the altar you can provide the altar with a Redstone signal (ex. button, lever)\n\nThe altar is primarily used to craft Mystical Agriculture seeds. See JEI for uses.",
