    "description": "The Oxygen Distributor is a machine that releases oxygen into the air in a closed room alongside regulating temperature. A closed room or sealed structure requires walls, and a ceiling with no gaps and without conventional doors. It\u0027s best to have an airlock system with two sets of doors to prevent leaking oxygen when entering a base. To distribute oxygen is needs to be supplied with a constant stream of power and oxygen, to regulate temperature it only requires power. ",
