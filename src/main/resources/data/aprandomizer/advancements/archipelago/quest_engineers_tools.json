    "description": "Use the manual to learn how to build each multiblock machine for Immersive Engineering.\n\nImmersive Engineering is about realism-inspired technology:\nInstead of glowing red tubes, it offers actual, hanging powerlines.\nInstead of one block that magically spits out dusts when ore is put in, it offers a crusher, a big multiblock (5x3x3) that features rotating wheels and spits out particles as it breaks the ore.\nInstead of a Laser that turns power into magical light and ores, it offers an Excavator, another massive, resource intensive, multiblock (3x7x8) which digs ores out of the ground with a big rotating bucketwheel.\n\nIE is about making tech mods more balanced and more pretty, and adding its own twist by going for retro-futurism (think BioShock, Order 1886, SkyCaptain and the World of Tomorrow) rather than clinical white+grey future cubes.\n\nIt uses the Forge Energy API, known from just about every other tech mod, but it can be played fully standalone. Unlike other mods, IE does not use power transfer via lanes of blocks, but instead via cables spanned between connectors.\n\nThe mod features Power Generation in forms of waterwheels, windmills, biodiesel and more and many of its machines are multiblocks!",
