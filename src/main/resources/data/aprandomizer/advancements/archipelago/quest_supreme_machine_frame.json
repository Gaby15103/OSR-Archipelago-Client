    "description": "Upgraded machine frames are crafted using the Dissolution Chamber. See JEI.\n\nTo obtain Ether:\n\nCraft a Stasis Chamber. The main purpose of the Stasis Chamber is to indefinitely contain a Wither. Using a Laser Drill with a Fluid Laser Base and a Purple Laser Lens produces Ether Gas when placed directly above a Wither. This fluid is required to craft Industrial Foregoing\u0027s most expensive items, including its highest tier machine frame.\n\nA Wither that is spawned inside an active Stasis Chamber\u0027s working area will be frozen immediately. It will not lose its invulnerability shield, but the Laser Drill ignores the shield. The Wither will not cause an explosion, and cannot take any actions. Despite this, the player may want to encase the working area in Wither-proof blocks anyway, to prevent any accidents should the Stasis Chamber ever run out of power. \n\nThe Stasis Chamber\u0027s default working area is a 3x3x3 cube directly above the machine. Its size can be increased using Range Addons. Players will be affected by Slowness while inside the machine\u0027s working area. ",
