    "description": "Growth Accelerators are used to increase the growth rate of the plant planted above them. They can be stacked below each other to provide additional growth speed.\n\nEach tier has an increased range, but provide the same amount of growth. Placing the maximum amount of each tier will be just as efficient as using only the max tier. Note that the range is relative to 1 block below the crop.\n\nPlace them underneath the block your plant is planted on. In the case of crops, that would be underneath the farmland block. Stack additional Growth Accelerators below it for more plant growth speed.",
