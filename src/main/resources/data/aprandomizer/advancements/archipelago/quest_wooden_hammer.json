Cobblestone -\u003e Gravel, Gravel -\u003e Sand, Sand -\u003e Dust, Netherrack -\u003e Crushed Netherrack, End Stone -\u003e Crushed End Stone, Cobbled Deepslate -\u003e Crushed Deepslate, Blackstone -\u003e Crushed Blackstone. Later, you can automate this process with a crusher from Mekanism. For now, vein mining and construction wands will be your friend. Also, try using compressed hammers (for compressed blocks)!",
