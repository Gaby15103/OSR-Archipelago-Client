Tom\u0027s Storage is also in this pack, which is great for the midgame while you are working on an Applied Energistics or Refined Storage system.\n\nPut your most frequently used items within convenient reach. Storage Drawers borrows ideas from Jabba and Bibliocraft, resulting in a highly functional, compact, and aesthetic storage solution that is meant to complement rather than replace other storage mods.",
