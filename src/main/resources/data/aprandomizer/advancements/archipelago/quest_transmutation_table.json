Transforming an item to pure EMC in this way imprints the identity of the item onto the soul of the alchemist. \n\nAnything known to the alchemist in this way can be pulled from any Transmutation Table or Transmutation Tablet by them as long as they have sufficient EMC. The Transmutation Table or Transmutation Tablet reveals to the alchemist the amount of EMC bound to them.",
