    "description": "Possible rewards from quests include chance cubes, reward bags, and coins. \n\nWhen broken, chance cubes cause a random event to occur. These can be potentially catastrophic to your base, so it would be a good idea to open chance cubes far away or in another dimension. \n\nReward bags (if given) are ranked based on the difficulty of the quest and can contain a wide variety of items, ranging from useless to amazing. Not all bags of the same level contain the same item; there is an element of chance. \n\nCoins can be redeemed at the coin shop for more reward bags. ",
