    "description": "Once your model is Basic or higher, you can use the simulation chamber to run simulations of your model. Simulations will always produce a generalized prediction, and may also produce a Mob Prediction, based on the accuracy of the model. The higher tier of the model, the higher the accuracy, up to 99.5% at Self Aware. Running simulations requires energy (based on the model type) and a catalyst item, which is usually a Prediction Matrix.",
