    "description": "A practicing alchemist like yourself has no time to constantly pick up and place down alchemical chests for storage. By sprinkling high power covalence dust on an alchemical chest and wrapping it in cloth, you\u0027ve managed to shrink the chest down to the size of a pouch. \n\nThe bag has all the capacity of the chest. Curiously, the bags seem to be bound to some metaphysical network, as all bags of the same color seem to contain the same items, regardless of if the bag was yours or your neighbor\u0027s. The bag also seems to activate items the same way the chest does.",
