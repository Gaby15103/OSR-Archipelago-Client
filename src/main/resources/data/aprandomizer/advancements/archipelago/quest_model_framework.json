    "description": "The fundamental unit of this mod is the Data Model - an item which holds information about an entity that you can utilize to generate their drops. To get a Data Model, you must first craft a Data Model Framework, and use it on the target entity to build the model. Once you have your model, you will have to train it.\n\nTraining a Data Model can be done in one of two ways, with a Deep Learner or with a Simulation Chamber. The deep learner allows you to store a few data models within, and kills you receive will begin to train the model. All models start out in the Faulty state, and must be trained up to Basic in the deep learner.",
