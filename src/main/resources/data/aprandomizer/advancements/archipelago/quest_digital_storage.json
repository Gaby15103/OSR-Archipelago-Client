AE2 has an in-game guide that can help you - configure the keybind and then hold the key while hovering over an AE2 item. If you choose AE2 over RS, you will have access to mods such as PackagedAuto. \n\n\u00262NOTE: You can pick which mod you prefer for this questline. You only need to have one item to complete the quest.\u0026r",
