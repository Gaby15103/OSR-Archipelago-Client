Place the ore dust in the top slot, and some cobblestone in the bottom slot, and it will combine to make the ore block. It requires 1000J per operation. Works with the dust of copper, iron, tin, osmium, obsidian (only needs 4) and gold. Also allows 1 Flint to a gravel block and 16 Redstone/Lapis to their ores. ",
