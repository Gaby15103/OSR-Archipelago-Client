    "description": "To get string to make a mesh, infest leaves by right-clicking on a leaf block with a silkworm (obtained by using a crook on leaves). The infested leaf will eventually spread to the entire tree. Harvest with a crook to obtain string!\nPlace a mesh inside of a sieve to generate resources from dirt, gravel, sand, and dust! Meshes can be used in both normal sieves and compressed sieves.\nNote: Construction wands and vein mining will be your friend in the early game. You can sift using multiple sieves at once by placing them next to each other (try a 3x3 square).",
