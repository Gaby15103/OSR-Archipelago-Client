    "description": "Take to the skies! Used to craft a wooden jetpack.\n\nJetpacks make use of Forge Energy to allow the player to fly. Higher tier Jetpacks can have greater speed and energy capacity.\n\nJetpacks require Forge Energy to function. They can be charged using a charging block from any mod that supports Forge Energy.\n\nThe Jetpack engine can be toggled on and off using a keybinding (default V). When the engine is on you can press the Space Bar to fly.\n\nEvery Jetpack has a Hover Mode, which allows for more precise movements. Enabling this mode (default keybinding H) will cause your Jetpack to hover in place with varying levels of descent. While hovering your Jetpack will consume power.\n\nYou can change the speed of your Jetpack using Throttle Controls. This is done using the Throttle Control keybindings (default , and .).\n\nJetpacks can be equipped as a Curio in the Body slot.\n\nNote: If the player wears a Jetpack in both the Curio slot and the Chestplate slot, the Jetpack in the Chestplate slot will take priority.",
